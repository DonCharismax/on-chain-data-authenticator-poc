# On-Chain Data Authenticator PoC by DonCharismax
# First version - September 2025

# --- Step 1: Import necessary libraries and tools (PLACEHOLDER) ---
# In a real project, you would import the Soundness Layer SDK and other libraries.
# import soundness_sdk
# from crypto_lib import ZKProofGenerator

# --- Step 2: Define a function to generate the ZK Proof ---
def generate_proof_for_data(data):
    """
    This function will take some data and generate a ZK proof.
    It simulates the process of creating the proof without revealing the data.

    # For now, we are just simulating the process.
    generated_proof = "mock_proof_data_12345"
    print("Proof generated successfully!")
    return generated_proof

# --- Step 3: Define a function to verify the ZK Proof ---
def verify_proof(proof):
    """
    This function will verify the authenticity and validity of the ZK proof.
    It simulates sending the proof to the Soundness Layer for verification.
    """

    # The API would return a result, like success or failure.

    if is_valid:
        print("Proof verified successfully on the testnet!")

# --- Step 4: Run the PoC to demonstrate the process ---
